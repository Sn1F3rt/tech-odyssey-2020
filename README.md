# Coding.py - Tech Odyssey 2020

## About

Tech Odyssey is a tech fest conducted by Modern Convent School, Dwarka. There were a diverse variety of events. I participated in the `Coding.py` event as the sole representative from our institution, Don Bosco School, Alaknanda.

I'm really glad to announce that I secured the first place in the event. :blush: :tada:

Now why this repository? So yeah, let's answer that. This isn't in anyway for bragging about my win, but because a lot of fellow participants were asking for the code I'd written, mostly for the last question which was pretty difficult. 

Here is the index:
