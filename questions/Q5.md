This year `p` footballers and `q` cricketers have been invited to participate in a competition as guests. You have to accommodate them in `r` rooms. 

**Constrains:** No room may remain empty, A room may contain either only footballers or only cricketers, not both. No cricketers are allowed to stay alone in a room.

Find the number of ways to place the players. Note though, that all the rooms are identical, but each of the cricketers and footballers is unique. 

Since the number of ways can be very large, print the answer modulo 998,244,353.

**Input:** The first line of the input contains a single integer `T` denoting the number of test cases. The description of `T` test cases follows. The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers `p`, `q`, and `r` denoting the number of footballers, cricketers, and rooms. 

**Output:** For each test case, output the number of ways to place the player's modulo 998,244,353.
