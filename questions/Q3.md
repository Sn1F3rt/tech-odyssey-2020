If magnetic flux is given by the dot product of magnetic field and area, then find the magnetic flux if magnetic field is B and area is A. 

**Inputs Given:** First line gives the number of test cases, second line consists of three numbers which gives the three vectors of magnetic field, Third line consists of three numbers which gives three vectors of area vector.The vectors are given in order of (i,j,k). 

The output should be an Integer.
